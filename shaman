# Shaman
___
A hulking orc swings his enormous greataxe in an arc, bringing it down hard into the shoulder of a slavering gnoll. Before the gnoll can launch his counterattack, the axe flashes upwards as if propelled by a sudden gust, and comes back down in an instant. The gnoll falls, dead before it hits the ground. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old elf stands knee-deep in a slow-moving stream, a wounded warrior kneeling before her. She dips her hands into the clear water, and as she washes his wounds, they start to scar and knit together before his very eyes.  

A stout dwarf stands atop a mound of sacred earth, hurling bolt after bolt of crackling lightning into the midst of the undead horde shambling towards the site of power.

Whether they are harnessing the speed and mobility of air, the defensive strength of earth, the destructive power of fire, or the healing energy of water, shamans use their link to the natural elements of the world to maintain the balance necessary for life to flourish.

### Masters of the Elements
Shamans are spiritual guides and practitioners, not of the divine, but of the very elements. Unlike some other mystics, shamans commune with forces that are not strictly benevolent. The elements are chaotic, and left to their own devices, they rage against one another in unending primal fury. 

It is the call of the shaman to bring balance to this chaos. Acting as moderators among earth, fire, water, and air, shamans summon totems that focus the elements to support the shaman’s allies or punish those who threaten them.

### Totems and Travel
All shamans can summon totems, which are physical manifestations of elemental power. Totems can take a variety of forms, depending on the element to which they belong and the personality of their summoner. Totems act as a focal point for their associated element, and can create a variety of minor effects that can ease both everyday life as well as adventuring and combat.


Although it is not unheard of for a lone shaman to live a hermetic life in one particular area, shamans are often nomadic by nature. They are compelled to follow the call of the elements, righting wrongs and ending disturbances to the natural order of things. Along the way, they might encounter friends and companions, and even other quests  to which they can commit themselves. A shaman will never forget their search for balance, but they will not necessarily spend every waking minute in devotion to it.

### Creating a Shaman

When creating  a shaman, there are two main questions to consider. Firstly, why does your character have such a strong connection to the elements? Are they the next in line for the title of tribal shaman, passed down from generation to generation? Were they the recipient of a boon from a generous elemental, or a grateful one? Were they taught the ways of the shaman by a mentor, or did they have to learn by themselves?

Secondly, why is your character out adventuring in the world? Have they always travelled from place to place, following the call of the elements? Or was there a specific event that set them on their jounrey? Maybe their home was destroyed, or a cataclysmic event such as a volcanic explosion or an earthquake foretold of dire events to come and triggered the start of their journey.

### Totems
Beginning at 1st level, you can summon helpful totems - minor focal points of elemental power. As an action, you can summon one of the following totems in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. 

Totems are small objects tha last for 1 minute or until destroyed. Only one totem can be active at any time. Summoning a new totem while another totem is already active destroys the old totem. 

Totems have an AC of 11 + your Wisdom modifier and 5 hit points. They have a bonus to all saving throws equal to your proficiency modifier + your Wisdom modifier. 

You can gain additional totem options through your shamanic specialization features, and when you reach 7th and 14th level in this class.

**Earthbind Totem (earth):** While active, this totem reduces the walking speed of all hostile creatures within a 10-foot radius by 10 feet. This effect can't reduce a creature's walking speed below 5 feet. The radius of this totem increases to 15 feet at 5th level, 20 feet at 11th level, and 30 feet at 17th level.


**Fire Nova Totem (fire):** On the turn that it is summoned, this totem is inert. As an action on a later turn, you can cause the totem to explode in a burst of searing flame. All creatures within a 10-foot radius of the totem must make a Dexterity save against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Taking this action destroys the totem. The damage of this totem increases to 3d8 at 5th level, 4d8 at 11th level, and 5d8 at 17th level. 



**Resistance Totem (water):** While active, you can use your reaction to reduce incoming damage to an ally within 10 feet of the totem by an amount equal to half your shaman level (rounded down) + your Wisdom modifier. You can use this totem a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier before it is destroyed. The range of this totem increases to 15 feet at 5th level, 20 feet at 11th level, and 30 feet at 17th level.

<div style='margin-top:400px'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Tranquil Air Totem (air):** While active, a creature that attempts to target you with an attack must first pass a Wisdom save against your spell save DC. On a fail, the creature must pick a new target, or lose the attack. The totem is then destroyed. The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you. The totem can be used twice before being destroyed at 5th level, 3 times at 11th level, and 4 times at 17th level.

### Lightning Blast
As a shaman, your mastery over the elements gives you the ability to hurl bolts of lightning at your foes. As an action on your turn, you can make a ranged spell attack roll using your spell attack modifier against a target you can see within 60 feet. 

On a hit, that target takes 1d8 lightning damage. The damage of this feature increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

### Spellcasting
By 2nd level, your connection to the elements has provided you with an innate knowledge of the inherent magics of the natural world. You can use this knowledge to harness the chaotic power of the elements, blasting your enemies with powerful spells or buffing and rejuvenating your allies with healing spirits. 


#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Shaman table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of shaman spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the shaman spell-list. When you do so, choose a number of shaman spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your shaman level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of shaman spells requires time spent in meditation and communication with the spirits: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

> ##### Elemental Totems
As the shaman who summons them, it is up to your character to decide how their totems will appear. Totems often take the form of an object that is important in some way to their summoner. For instance, the totems of a mountain dwarf with a long family history of smithing might take the shape of an anvil.

> A totem's appearance is also influenced by the element to which it is bound. For example, a fire totem summoned by the dwarf above may be wreathed in flames, while a water totem might spout a small fountain of water from the top. 

\page

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your shaman spells. Your magic comes from communication with and mastery of the natural elemental forces of the world. You use your Wisdom modifier whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a shaman spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 

<div style="text-align: center">

**Spell save DC =** 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier =** your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier 
</div>
 

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a totemic focus as a spellcasting focus for your shaman spells. This focus is a small symbol of your connection to the elements - it might be a silver medallion in the shape of a raindrop, a jar of dirt from a holy place, or a jagged piece of obsidian inscribed with runes. A totemic focus can be attached to a shield you are holding.


### Shock Spells
Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your control over the elements to enhance your combat abilities. Choose one of the following Shock spell options to learn. Whenever you hit a target with a melee attack or your Lightning Blast feature, you can expend one spell slot to additionally affect your target with the Shock spell you have chosen. For each spell level higher than 1st that you expend t cast a Shock spell, the initial damage is increased by 1d6, up to a maximum of 5d6.
	
You can choose one additional Shock spell to learn at 6th level, 10th level, and 18th level. 


**Earth Shock:** The target is hit with a powerful mound of earth. The target takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you. The target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.

**Flame Shock:** The target is set alight, taking an additional 1d6 fire damage, and an additional 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of their subsequent turns. The target can make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.  

**Frost Shock:** The target is hit with a shock of cold, taking an additional 1d6 cold damage, and their speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. 

**Thunder Shock:** The target is blasted with a loud crash of thunder. They take an additional 1d6 thunder damage, and must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be knocked prone. 

**Wind Shear:** The target is buffeted with a powerful gust, taking an additional 1d6 slashing damage. If the target is concentrating on a spell, they have disadvantage on their concentration check to maintain it. 
<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>




### Elemental Attunement
At 3rd level, you have strengthened your bonds with the elements. By spending 10 minutes in meditation, you can determine whether any elementals are within a 1-mile radius, as well as their general direction from your present location.

In addition, you learn Primordial, the language of elementals, and become fluent in all of its dialects: Aquan, Auran, Ignan and Terran. 

### Shamanic Specialization
At 3rd level, you choose your shamanic specialization. Each of the different specializations focus on one of the many aspects of elemental balance. Elemental shamans use the devastating powers of air and fire to damage and debilitate foes from a distance. Enhancement shamans use the forces of earth and fire to enhance their martial prowess at the front lines. Restoration shamans use the healing powers of air and water to protect their friends and rejuvenate their wounds. 

Your shamanic specialization grants you additional features when you first choose it at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, 15th and 20th level.

#### Specialization Spells
Each specialization has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the specialization description. Once you gain access to a specialization spell, you always have it prepared. Specialization spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain a specialization spell that doesn’t appear on the shaman spell list, the spell is nonetheless a shaman spell for you.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by +2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by +1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Elemental Fury

By 5th level, you have focused your attention on unleashing either devestating spells or furious weapon blows. You can choose one of the following benefits to gain:

* **Extra Attack:** You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the attack action on your turn.
* **Empowered Lightning:** You can add your Wisdom modifier to the damage dealt by your Lightning Blast feature.

### Far Sight
At 6th level, you can hone in your control over the element of air to clear and intensify your vision. You can use an action to activate your Far Sight. With Far Sight active, you can see perfectly up to 1 mile away, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away. Additionally, dim light doesn’t impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks while Far Sight is active. 

Far Sight lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom modifier. After you have used this feature, you can't use it again until you have finished a long rest.

### Greater Totems
At 7th level, the elemental power of your totems has stengthened. The AC of your totems increases to 12 + your Wisdom modifier, and their hitpoints increase to 10.

Starting at 10th level, your mastery over the elements extends to commanding their servants. You gain advantage on all Charisma-based checks to persuade, intimidate or deceive while speaking Primordial. In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks against speakers of Primordial. 

### Totemic Mastery
At 14th level, you have mastered your control over your totems. You gain the following benefits:

* You can now use a bonus action rather than an action to summon totems. In addition, you can use a bonus action on your turn to move your active totem to any unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of your current location.

<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>

**Spirit Link Totem (air):** While active, whenever an ally within 20 feet of the totem takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically take that damage, instead of that creature taking it. The totem doesn't transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage, and this damage can't be reduced in any way. The range of this totem increases to 30 feet at 17th level.

**Tremor Totem (earth):** While active, all friendly creatures within 20 feet of the totem gain advantage on saving throws against the *charmed*, *frightened* and *stunned* conditions. The range of this totem increases to 30 feet at 17th level.

### Primordial Fortitude
Beginning at 18th level, your body has hardened itself to the effects of the elements. You no longer suffer the effects of extreme cold or heat, and can survive indefinitely without eating or drinking.








## Shamanic Specializations

### Elemental
Elemental shamans are spellcasters who harness the destructive forces of nature and the elements to bring ruin to their enemies. They strive to perfect their mastery over the four elements, and have gained a particular affinity for lightning, which they use both defensively and offensively.

**Searing Totem (fire):** While active, you can use a bonus action on your turn to make a ranged spell attack roll with your spell attack modifier against a target within 20 feet of the totem.

<div style='margin-top:5000px'></div>

#### Stormcaller

At 20th level, you can use an action to channel the destructive power of the elements through your body. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
* Whenever you hit a target with your Lightning Blast feature, you can afflict the target with a Shock spell you know, cast at 1st level, without expending a spell slot. You can increase the effect of this Shock spell by expending higher level spell slots as usual.
* You gain resistance to all cold, fire, and lightning damage.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.


### Enhancement 
Enhancement shamans are totemic warriors who strike with weapons imbued with elemental power. They harness the primordial power of nature to strengthen both their bodies and their minds. They are mobile warriors whose movement and attacks appear as whirlwinds to their foes. Many enhancement shamans choose to fight with two weapons, raining down a storm of blows on their opponents, though some prefer heavier weapons or take up the shield and become true protectors of the elements.

#### Specialization Spells
You gain access to specialization spells at the shaman levels listed below.
##### Enhancement Spells
| Shaman Level | Spells |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 3rd  | *longstrider, zephyr strike* |

| 9th | *elemental weapon, haste* |
| 13th | *astral recall, freedom of movement* |

* Your hit point maximum increases by 3, and increases by 1 whenever you take another level in this class.
* The initial damage of your Shock spells increases by 1d6 of the relevant damage type. The maximum damage of a Shock spell still can't exceed 5d6. 

#### Fighting Style

Also at 3rd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose a fighting style from the list of optional features. You can't take the same fighting style option more than once, even if you get to choose again.

**Defense:** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

**Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.


\page

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Great Weapon Fighting:** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

**Protection:** When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

**Two-Weapon Fighting:** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

#### Windfury Weapon
Beginning at 7th level, your weapons have become imbued with wind, allowing them to strike with deadly swiftness.

Whenever you roll to hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can also roll a d10 as your Windfury Weapon die. On a roll of 10 on this d10, you can immediately make one additional attack with the same weapon against the same target. This effect can only trigger once per turn. 


#### Feral Spirit
Beginning at 11th level, the primal force of your spirit manifests itself as two spectral wolves who harass and harangue your opponents. 

Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d6 force damage as the spirit wolves snap at them with hungry jaws.


#### Primal Empowerment
Beginning at 15th level, whenever a spell is cast on you that restores hit points or removes a condition, you gain temporary hit points equal to the spell's spell level + your Wisdom modifier.

#### Astral Shift
At 20th level, you can use your connection to the elements to fade partly into the elemental plane. You can activate this feature using an action, and gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
* You gain resistance to all bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage.
* You ignore spells and effects that reduce your movement speed, and are immune to the *restrained* and *paralysed* conditions. 
* The extra damage done by your Feral Spirit feature is maximised.

Once you have used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Restoration
Restoration shamans are healers who call upon the ancestral spirits and the cleansing power of water to heal their allies’ wounds. Restoration shamans are in constant communion with the spirits, seeking their aid and advice in all things. Though devoted to calming the raging elements, restoration shamans are still powerful spellcasters in their own right and more than capable of holding their own in battle.

<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>


#### Specialization Spells
You gain access to specialization spells at the shaman levels listed below.
##### Restoration Spells
| Shaman Level | Spells |
|:----:|:-------------|

| 5th  | *aid, gentle repose* |
| 9th | *beacon of hope, revivify* |
| 13th | *death ward, stoneskin* |
| 17th | *greater restoration, mass cure wounds* |

#### Healing Stream

When you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you gain the ability to channel healing energy through your totemic focus. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals 2 + half your shaman level (rounded down).

As a bonus action, you can present your totemic focus to heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one die). Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore a number of hit points equal to the total.

Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

#### Chain Healing
Beginning at 7th level, whenever you expend a spell slot to cast a spell that restores hit points to a single target , you can cause the healing magic to jump to a nearby ally. As a bonus action, you can choose a willing creature within 10 feet of the initial target. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.


#### Water Shield
Beginning at 11th level, you can use an action to surround yourself in a protective watery shield. While this shield is active, you gain the following benefits:

* You have advantage on concentration checks to maintain concentration on your shaman spells.
* Whenever you use dice from your Healing Stream pool to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the amount of dice you rolled.
* Once per round when you take damage from an enemy, the shield gains 1 charge. If the shield gains 3 charges, you can expend all charges by using a bonus action on your turn to restore a 1st level spell slot. 

The shield dissipates after 10 minutes, losing all charges in the process. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you have finished a long rest. 



#### Wellspring
Starting at 15th level, whenever you enter combat with no dice in your Healing Stream pool, you regain 1 expended die from the pool. 

#### Mana Tide Totem
At 20th level, you gain the following option when summoning totems:

**Mana Tide Totem (water):** While active, whenever an ally within 30 feet of the totem expends a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, they can roll a d20 and add their spellcasting modifier to the result. On a roll of 15 or higher, they can regain a spell slot of 1st level. On a roll of 20 or higher, they can regain a spell slot of up to 2nd level. On a roll of 25 or higher, they can regain a spell slot of up to 3rd level. 

The slot that is regained must be at least one spell level lower than the slot that was expended to cast the spell. 

Once you have summoned this totem, you can't summon it again until you have finished a long rest.

### Shaman Spells

#### Ghost Wolf
*1st-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You meld into the form of a spectral wolf, and move up to 40 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see before shifting back to your normal form. Opportunity attacks that you provoke with this movement are made at disadvantage. 

#### Lightning Shield
*2nd-level abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (an amber rod and a piece of fur)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

You choose a willing creature you can see within range and cast a protective shield around them. Three fist-sized motes of lightning rotate slowly around the target for the duration. Whenever the target is hit by a melee attack while at least one mote is active, they can use their reaction to cause one of the motes to explode, dealing 1d8 lightning damage to the attacker and destroying the mote in the process. 

** *At Higher Levels.* ** When you cast this spell using a 3rd or 4th level slot, the damage of each mote increases to 2d8. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage of each mote increases to 3d8. 







#### Astral Recall
*4th-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take in response to dropping to 0 hit points
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** M (an ankh-shaped pendant worth at least 500gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

The force of your will binds your spirit back to your body. You immediately gain hit points equal to your spellcasting modifier (minimum of 1 hit point). 




#### Bloodlust
*5th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sand soaked with blood)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You call upon the chaotic nature of the elements to drive your allies into a frenzy. Choose up to three willing creatures you can see within range. Until the spell ends, their walking speed is doubled, and they can make one additional weapon attack when they take the attack action on their turn.

A creature under the effects of *haste* can't be targeted by *bloodlust* and vice versa.

When the spell ends, all targets immediately take 2d12 necrotic damage as the bloodlust takes its toll. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way.
